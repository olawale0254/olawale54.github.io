I conduct my research at the intersection of artificial intelligence and medicine at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/person/charles-c-onu/) and the [Reasoning and Learning (RL) lab](http://rl.cs.mcgill.ca/index.html) at McGill. I work under the supervision of  [Prof. Doina Precup](https://mila.quebec/en/person/doina-precup/), co-director of RL lab and director of the DeepMind lab in Montreal. My research interests are around the issues of representation learning, multi-modal fusion, few-shot learning, and transfer learning.

I am the founder of [Ubenwa](http://ubenwa.com/), a social venture aiming to save newborn lives through low-cost, cry-based diagnostic technology powered by AI. Our work is funded by generous grants from Mila, Ministère de l’Économie, et d'Innovation ([MEI](https://www.economie.gouv.qc.ca/en/)) de Québec, and [District 3](http://d3center.ca/).
